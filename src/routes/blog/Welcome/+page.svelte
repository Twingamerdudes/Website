	<h1>Welcome!ðŸ‘‹</h1>
    <p>This is the first blog!
		Here I will post updates about videos, projects and life in general!</p>
    <p>Also, to clear up some questions, no, making a FNF Engine part 4 will probably not come out.</p>
    <p>This is a pretty short post, however most posts I make will be longer then this.</p>
    <p>Anyways, have I amazing day, I will see you in my next video, livestream, devlog, or blog post now I guess.
        Peace!
